## Setup

This project requires you to have [node / npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) 
and [bower](http://bower.io/) installed globally. Refer to the respective documentations on how to 
do just that.

Setting the project up locally is easy as 1-2-3:

### Step 1: Install npm dependencies

    npm install

### Step 2: Install bower dependencies

    bower install

### Step 3: Compile and start server

    gulp

And hopefully, you should be up and running.
